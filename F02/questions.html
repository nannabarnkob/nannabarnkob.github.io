  <p> <b> Excercise: Questions for DAOST </b>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>  Explain in your own words the point of the jitter plot.</li>
			<li>  Explain in your own words the point of figure 2-3. (I'm going to skip saying "in your own words" going forward, but I hope you get the point; I expect all answers to be in your own words).</li>
			<li> The author of DAOST (Philipp Janert) likes KDEs (and think they're better than histograms). And I don't. I didn't give a detailed explanation in the video, but now that works to my advantage. I'll ask you guys to think about this and thereby create an excellent exercise: When can KDEs be misleading? (I'll provide the answer in a later lecture :)</li>
			<li>  I've discussed some strengths of the CDF - there are also weaknesses. Janert writes "[CDFs] have less intuitive appeal than histograms of KDEs". What does he mean by that?</li>
			<li>  What is a Quantile plot? What is it good for.</li>
			<li>  How is a Probablity plot defined? What is it useful for? Have you ever seen one before?</li>
			<li>  One of the reasons I like DAOST is that Janert is so suspicious of mean, median, and related summary statistics. Explain why one has to be careful when using those - and why visualization of the full data is always better.</li>
			<li>  I love box plots. When are box plots most useful? </li>
			<li>   The book doesn't mention violin plots. Are those better or worse than box plots? Why? </li>
