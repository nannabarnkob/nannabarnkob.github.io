    <h1> Questions for chapter 7 </h1>
    <ul>
      <li> Explain in your own words: What is the point of scales?
      <li> Why are d3.min() and d3.max() useful? And what's the accessor function? When do you need that?
      <li> What is Bostock's margin convention mentioned on page 125?
      <li> Can you mention an example when you might need other scales than linear?
      <li> How do you convert strings to Date objects? When is it good to check that your conversion works? Do you have to be extra careful with Danish dates? Why?
    </ul>
